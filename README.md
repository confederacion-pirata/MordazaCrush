MordazaCrush
============

"Mordaza" is the Spanish word meaning "gag". Also used as the common title for the law proposal by the Spanish goverment, which is trying to avoid __recordings of demonstrations and any kind of public protest__ where, unfortunatly, police officers use their power of authority in a disproportionate way.

This app can __take photos and publish them on the Internet automatically as soon as possible__, so they will be available for media press and, at the same time, destruction of seized mobiles will be futile.
